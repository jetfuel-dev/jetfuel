<b>Python Performance Profiling for Production</b><br>
<b>~ It's About Time ~</b>
</p>

Jetfuel is a performance profiler that can monitor the performance of your production Python, and makes results easy to aggregate and search through.

Jetfuel is designed for **Purposeful Profiling**. This means that you only use Jetfuel around code of interest, instead of dumping all code performance logs and mining it later.

Useful for Profiling:

- ðŸŒŽ API performance
- ðŸš€ CI/CD stage / granular performance
- ðŸ’¡ ML training & inference jobs
- ðŸ“€ Database queries
- ðŸ“Š Data pipelines / compute jobs

Bad performance has [real world consequences](https://uxplanet.org/how-page-speed-affects-web-user-experience-83b6d6b1d7d7), and is often a result of **lack of visibility**, *even if you are logging it, if it's not be easy to get to, it will be ignored*.
