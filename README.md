# Mocha

Mocha is a Python performance profiler that can monitor your entire deployment in production, and makes results easy to aggregate and search through.

Bad code performance is often a result of lack of visibility, with [real world consequences](https://uxplanet.org/how-page-speed-affects-web-user-experience-83b6d6b1d7d7).

## Install 

```bash
pip install mocha-time
```
