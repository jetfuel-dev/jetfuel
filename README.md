<b>Python Performance Profiling for Production</b><br>
<b>~ It's About Time ~</b>
</p>

Jetfuel is a performance profiler that can monitor the performance of your production Python, and makes results easy to aggregate and search through.

Jetfuel is designed for **Purposeful Profiling**. This means that you only use Jetfuel around code of interest, instead of dumping all code performance logs and mining it later.

Useful for Profiling:

- ðŸŒŽ API performance
- ðŸš€ CI/CD stage / granular performance
- ðŸ’¡ ML training & inference jobs
- ðŸ“€ Database queries
- ðŸ“Š Data pipelines / compute jobs

Bad performance has [real world consequences](https://uxplanet.org/how-page-speed-affects-web-user-experience-83b6d6b1d7d7), and is often a result of **lack of visibility**, *even if you are logging it, if it's not be easy to get to, it will be ignored*.

## How does it work?

Jetfuel is very simple. The client simply times sections of your code, and batches / aggregates them before committing to the Jetfuel server. Updates are aggregated based on a configurable resolution (default 5s). This batching / aggregating behavior allows us to time ms/ns code without introducing much overhead.

## Installation

```bash
pip install jetfuel
```

```bash
docker run -it -p 9000:9000 -v ${PWD}/data:/bin/jetfuel/data jetfuel/jetfuel
```

## Demo

```python
import jetfuel

jetfuel.init(url="http://localhost:9000")

jetfuel.demo()
```

## Usage

1. Start / Stop

    ```python
    p = jetfuel.start("Foobar")
    pass
    p.stop()
    ```

2. Profiler

    ```python
    with jetfuel.Profiler("Foobar"):
        pass
    ```

3. Function Decorator

    ```python
    @jetfuel.profiler("Foobar")
    def ml_training():
        pass
    ```
